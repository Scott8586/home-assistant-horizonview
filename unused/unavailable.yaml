I had exactly the same issue, that I get a notification when the state goes from “unavailable” to “0”.

I made a condition for the automation:

Copy to clipboard
- condition: template
    value_template: '{{ trigger.from_state.state != "unavailable" }}'
Maybe this is also a solution for your problem.
